## The Build vs Buy Decision

Every business faces this choice: buy existing software or build something custom. The answer depends on your specific needs, but here's what most people get wrong.

### When Off-the-Shelf Works

Ready-made software makes sense when:
- Your needs are generic (email, basic accounting, project management)
- You're a small team with standard workflows
- Budget is extremely limited and time-sensitive

### When Custom Software Wins

Custom development becomes the better choice when:

**1. Your Process Is Your Advantage**

If your business does something differently than competitors—and that difference matters—generic software forces you to change your process. Custom software adapts to you.

**2. Integration Requirements**

Most businesses run 10+ software tools. Off-the-shelf products rarely talk to each other well. Custom software can connect everything into one workflow.

**3. Scaling Costs**

SaaS pricing usually scales with users or usage. At some point, monthly fees exceed what custom development would cost—and you'd own the result.

**4. Data Ownership**

With custom software, your data stays on your servers. You control security, backups, and compliance. No vendor lock-in.

### Real Cost Comparison

A typical SaaS tool costs $50-200/user/month. For a 50-person company:
- SaaS: $30,000-120,000/year, ongoing forever
- Custom: $80,000-150,000 one-time, plus maintenance

By year three, custom often costs less. By year five, significantly less.

### The Right Approach

Start with off-the-shelf for non-critical functions. Invest in custom development for core business processes where software directly impacts revenue or efficiency.

Most successful companies use both—they just know which is which.

## The Platform Decision

"Should we build a mobile app or web app first?" We hear this from almost every startup. Here's how to decide.

### Start With Web (Usually)

For most B2B products and many B2C products, web should come first:

**Faster Development**
Web apps typically take 30-50% less time to build than native mobile apps. One codebase works everywhere.

**Easier Updates**
Push changes instantly. No app store approval process. Fix bugs in minutes, not days.

**Better for Validation**
Test your idea faster. Pivot without rebuilding everything. Users can try without downloading anything.

**SEO Benefits**
Web apps get indexed by search engines. Free organic traffic. Mobile apps don't.

### Start With Mobile When...

Mobile-first makes sense in specific cases:

- Camera/GPS/sensors are core features
- Offline functionality is essential
- Push notifications drive engagement
- Your audience lives on mobile (certain consumer apps)

### The Progressive Web App Middle Ground

PWAs give you mobile app features (offline, push notifications, home screen icon) with web app benefits. For many products, this is the right first step.

### Our Recommendation

1. Build a responsive web app first
2. Validate your core product
3. Add PWA features
4. Build native mobile only when you have proven demand

This approach minimizes risk and maximizes learning speed. You can always build mobile later—but you can't get back the money spent on a mobile app nobody uses.

### Cost Comparison

- Web app: $40,000-100,000
- iOS app: $50,000-150,000
- Android app: $50,000-150,000
- PWA: $50,000-120,000

Building web first lets you validate before tripling your investment.

## Choosing Your Tech Stack

The tech stack decision paralyzes many founders. Here's the practical approach.

### The Only Rule That Matters

**Use what your team knows.**

A great developer using familiar tools will outperform a great developer learning new tools. Speed matters more than theoretical perfection.

### If You're Starting Fresh

For most web applications in 2024:

**Frontend:**
- React or Next.js (largest ecosystem, easiest hiring)
- TypeScript (catches bugs, better developer experience)
- Tailwind CSS (fast styling, consistent design)

**Backend:**
- Node.js for JavaScript teams
- Python/Django for data-heavy apps
- Go for high-performance requirements

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL (handles 90% of use cases well)
- MongoDB only if you truly have unstructured data

**Infrastructure:**
- Vercel or Netlify for frontend
- AWS or Google Cloud for backend
- Start simple, optimize later

### Common Mistakes

**1. Overengineering**
You don't need Kubernetes on day one. You don't need microservices for an MVP. Start simple.

**2. Chasing Trends**
That new framework might be exciting, but can you hire developers who know it? Will it exist in 3 years?

**3. Premature Optimization**
Build for 1,000 users first. Scale when you actually have scaling problems.

### Our Standard Stack

For most client projects, we use:
- Next.js (React framework)
- TypeScript
- PostgreSQL
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel or AWS

This stack is boring—and that's the point. Boring technology is reliable, well-documented, and easy to maintain.

### When to Deviate

Consider alternatives when:
- Your app has specific performance requirements (games, real-time trading)
- You're building in a specialized domain (ML, blockchain)
- Your team has deep expertise in something else

Otherwise, go with proven tools and focus on building your product.

## MVP Development Reality Check

Everyone wants to know: "How much will my app cost?" Here's the honest answer.

### What's an MVP?

A Minimum Viable Product is the simplest version that delivers core value. It's not:
- A prototype (that's just a demo)
- A complete product (that comes later)
- A proof of concept (that's for internal validation)

An MVP is something real users can actually use.

### Realistic Timelines

**Simple MVP (8-12 weeks)**
- 5-10 screens
- Basic user authentication
- Core functionality only
- Simple database
- One platform (web or mobile)

**Medium MVP (12-20 weeks)**
- 10-20 screens
- User roles and permissions
- Third-party integrations
- Payment processing
- Admin dashboard

**Complex MVP (20-30 weeks)**
- 20+ screens
- Real-time features
- Complex business logic
- Multiple integrations
- Advanced security requirements

### Realistic Costs

Based on North American development rates:

- Simple MVP: $40,000-80,000
- Medium MVP: $80,000-150,000
- Complex MVP: $150,000-300,000

Offshore development costs 40-60% less but often takes longer and requires more management.

### What Affects Cost

**Scope (biggest factor)**
Every feature adds weeks. Ruthlessly cut features for your first version.

**Design Requirements**
Custom design costs more than templates. For MVPs, start simple.

**Technical Complexity**
Real-time features, complex algorithms, and third-party integrations all add cost.

**Team Location**
North American developers: $150-250/hour
Eastern European: $50-100/hour
South Asian: $25-50/hour

### How to Budget

1. Define your core use case (one sentence)
2. List only features that use case requires
3. Get 3 quotes from development teams
4. Add 30% buffer for unexpected issues
5. Plan for post-launch iteration

### Common Mistake

Building too much before validating. Spend 60% of your budget on version 1, save 40% for improvements based on real user feedback.

## APIs Explained Simply

Your business probably runs on multiple software tools that don't talk to each other. APIs fix that.

### What's an API?

API stands for Application Programming Interface. Think of it as a translator that lets different software systems share information automatically.

**Without API:**
You manually export data from System A, reformat it, and import it into System B. Every day. Forever.

**With API:**
System A automatically sends data to System B whenever something changes. No manual work.

### Real Examples

**CRM + Email Marketing**
When a new customer signs up in your CRM, they're automatically added to your email list with the right tags.

**E-commerce + Accounting**
Every sale automatically creates an invoice in your accounting software. No manual entry.

**HR System + Payroll**
Time-off requests approved in HR flow directly to payroll calculations.

### Why Integrate?

**Save Time**
Manual data entry takes hours. APIs work in seconds.

**Reduce Errors**
Humans make typos. APIs don't.

**Real-Time Data**
Make decisions based on current information, not yesterday's export.

**Scale Operations**
Handle 10x the volume without hiring 10x the staff.

### Integration Options

**1. Native Integrations**
Many tools have built-in connections. Check if your software already supports this.

**2. Zapier/Make**
No-code tools that connect 5,000+ apps. Good for simple workflows.

**3. Custom Integration**
Built specifically for your needs. More powerful, more expensive.

### What to Expect

**Timeline:** 2-8 weeks depending on complexity
**Cost:** $5,000-50,000 for custom integrations

### Questions to Ask

Before starting an integration project:
1. What data needs to move between systems?
2. How often does it need to sync?
3. What happens when something fails?
4. Who maintains it long-term?

Integration projects pay for themselves quickly—usually within 6-12 months through time savings alone.

## The Website Redesign Checklist

Most redesigns fail because teams focus on looks and forget function. Use this checklist.

### Before You Start

**1. Document Current Performance**
Export your Google Analytics data. Note current rankings for important keywords. You need baselines to measure improvement.

**2. List What's Working**
Don't redesign pages that already convert well. Keep what works.

**3. Identify Real Problems**
"It looks dated" isn't enough. What specific business problems will the redesign solve?

### Planning Phase

**4. Define Success Metrics**
How will you know the redesign worked? Pick 2-3 measurable goals.

**5. Map User Journeys**
What do visitors actually do on your site? Design for their needs, not your org chart.

**6. Content Inventory**
List every page. Decide: keep, update, merge, or delete. Most sites have 30% dead content.

### Design Phase

**7. Mobile First**
60%+ of traffic is mobile. Design for phones first, then expand to desktop.

**8. Page Speed Budget**
Set a target: under 3 seconds on mobile. Test every page.

**9. Accessibility**
WCAG compliance isn't optional. Check contrast, alt text, keyboard navigation.

### Development Phase

**10. URL Structure**
Changing URLs kills SEO. Keep them the same, or set up 301 redirects for every page.

**11. Technical SEO**
Meta titles, descriptions, schema markup, sitemap, robots.txt. All must transfer correctly.

**12. Forms and Tracking**
Test every form. Verify analytics, conversion tracking, and CRM integrations.

### Launch Phase

**13. Staged Rollout**
Don't launch everything at once. Start with less important pages, verify everything works.

**14. Monitor Everything**
Watch analytics daily for two weeks. Look for traffic drops, conversion changes, error pages.

**15. Redirect Audit**
Check for 404 errors. Fix broken links. Search Console will show issues.

### Post-Launch

Compare performance at 30, 60, and 90 days. If metrics dropped, diagnose and fix immediately.

A good redesign improves metrics within 90 days. If yours didn't, something went wrong.
